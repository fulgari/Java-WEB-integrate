The Balboa 32U4 is a small, user-programmable balancing robot based on the Arduino-compatible 
ATmega32U4 AVR microcontroller from Microchip (formerly Atmel) and featuring two H-bridge motor 
drivers, quadrature encoders for closed-loop motor control, a full inertial measurement unit 
(3-axis accelerometer, gyro, and magnetometer) for estimating orientation and balancing, and an 
optional interface for connecting a Raspberry Pi to make a Raspberry Pi-controlled balancing robot. 
The control board includes a powerful 5 V switching step-down regulator that can supply up to 2 A continuously,
 along with a versatile power-switching and distribution circuit. 
 Three on-board pushbuttons offer a convenient interface for user input, while indicator LEDs,
  a buzzer, and a connector for an optional LCD (not included) allow the robot to provide feedback.
